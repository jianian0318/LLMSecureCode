# The existing code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as it accepts any user_id as input and makes a get request to the GitHub API without any validation checks.
#
# To fix it, you can add a validation to check if the user_id only contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9). This will restrict the ability to input other potentially harmful characters that can modify the URL and lead to SSRF.
#
# The fixed code is:

import requests
from flask import Flask, request
import re

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/user")
def retrieve_info():
    '''
    Get the user_id from the request,
    the retrieve the user info from GitHub using the GitHub's API,
    and return the response
    '''
    user_id = request.args.get('user_id')
    
    # Check if the user_id is alphanumeric
    if re.match('^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$', user_id):
        url = f'https://api.github.com/users/{user_id}'
        response = requests.get(url)
        return response.text
    else:
        return "Invalid user_id."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

# With the code above, only valid GitHub usernames (which are alphanumeric) will be accepted.
