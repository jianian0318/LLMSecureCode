# To fix the CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) vulnerability in this code, we need to apply proper resource handling and impose constraints on input patterns and sizes. The vulnerability in the given code arises from the use of a regular expression search (`re.search`) without any limitations on the input that a user may provide. An attacker could exploit this by supplying a specially crafted input designed to cause excessive computation, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
#
# Here's the fixed code with input validation and length restrictions:

import re
from flask import request, Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define maximum allowed length for username and filename
MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH = 64
MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH = 256

@app.route('/upload')
def upload():
    '''
    Get the username and a file attachment from the HTTP GET request.
    Then, search the username in the filename of the attachment.
    Ensure that the username and filename have reasonable lengths
    and do not process invalid patterns.
    '''
    username = request.args.get('username')
    filename = request.args.get('filename')

    if username and filename:
        # Ensure the inputs do not exceed our defined maximum lengths
        if len(username) > MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH or len(filename) > MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH:
            return 'Username or filename too long'

        # Restrict the pattern of the username to alphanumeric characters and a few special characters
        # using a regular expression pattern that allows a limited set of characters.
        safe_username_pattern = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{1,64}$')
        
        if not safe_username_pattern.match(username):
            return 'Invalid username'

        if username in filename:
            return 'Username found in filename'
        else:
            return 'Username not found in filename'
    else:
        return 'Username or filename not provided'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()


# In this updated code, I've implemented the following changes:
#
# 1. Added `MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH` and `MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH` to define reasonable maximum lengths for the `username` and `filename` variables.
# 2. Added a check to ensure the lengths of `username` and `filename` do not exceed the defined maximum lengths.
# 3. Instead of using `re.search` which could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption, I've replaced it with a direct substring check (i.e., `username in filename`).
# 4. Restricted the accepted pattern for username using a safer regular expression (`safe_username_pattern`) and Python's `re.compile` and `match` methods.
#
# By validating the lengths and patterns of user inputs, we reduce the risk of DoS attacks and improve the security of the code.
