# The above code has vulnerabilities because it doesn't verify the signature of the JWT token. The following is the correct code.


import jwt

SECRET_KEY = "<Your Secret Key>"

def verifyJWTToken(jwt_token):
    '''
    Verify the JWT Token and return it.
    '''
    try:
        decoded_token = jwt.decode(jwt_token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms='HS256')
        return decoded_token
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        return None


# Here, you need to replace "<Your Secret Key>" with the actual secret key used for generating the JWT token. The code is using the HS256 algorithm for verifying the signature, but you can replace it with any other supported algorithm according to your requirements.
