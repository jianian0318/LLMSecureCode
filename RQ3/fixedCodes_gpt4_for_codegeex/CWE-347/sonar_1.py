# The above code has a vulnerability because it disables verification of a cryptographic signature by using `verify=False`. Here is the corrected code:
#

import jwt

SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key here'

def verifyJsonWebToken(token):
    '''
    Decode the JSON web token passed and return it.
    '''
    try:
        decoded_token = jwt.decode(token, key=SECRET_KEY, algorithms=['HS256'])
        return decoded_token
    except jwt.exceptions.InvalidTokenError as e:
        print(f"Invalid token: {e}")

# In the corrected code, I have removed `verify=False` and added the `key=SECRET_KEY` argument to `jwt.decode()`. You have to replace `"Your secret key here"` with your actual secret key. This code now verifies the cryptographic signature of the token. If the token has been tampered with, `jwt.decode()` will raise an `InvalidTokenError`. If this occurs, a message is printed to the console and no data from the token is returned.
