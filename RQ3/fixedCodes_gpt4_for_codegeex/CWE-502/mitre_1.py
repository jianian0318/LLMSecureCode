# It's indeed risky to directly deserialize untrusted data since it can lead to harmful consequences such as arbitrary code execution. The 'loads' or 'load' function from cPickle is harmful if it's allowed to deserialize data from an untrusted source.
#
# One simple solution could be replacing 'cPickle.loads' with your own checking function which the authenticated user's data is tracked record. You need to replace the condition where you have directly called 'cPickle.loads' to process the decoded_token. A pseudo-part of the code is written as 'process_token' function could look like this:


class UnauthorizedAccess(Exception):
    pass


def process_token(decoded_token):
    user = get_user_from_decoded_token(decoded_token)
    if user is None or not user.is_authenticated:
        raise UnauthorizedAccess('Invalid or expired auth token')


def get_user_from_decoded_token(decoded_token):
    # Implementation specific: return User instance or None if not authenticated


def confirmAuth(headers):
    auth_token = headers.get('AuthToken')
    if auth_token:
        decoded_token = base64.b64decode(auth_token)
        try:
            process_token(decoded_token)
            # The logic after token validation
            return token_object.data
        except UnauthorizedAccess:
            return None
    else:
        return None


# Please replace `get_user_from_decoded_token` function with the actual implementation based on your system's user authentication mechanism. The process_token function doesn't have deserialization with cPickle now and it only processes the token using your own defined logic. UnauthorizedAccess exception will be raised if the user is not authenticated.
