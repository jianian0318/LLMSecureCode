# The original code is vulnerable because it uses the `pickle` module, which can result in arbitrary code execution when deserializing untrusted data.
#
# To fix the vulnerability, I'll use the module `json` for serialization/deserialization as it doesn't execute arbitrary code.
#
# Here's the fixed Python code:


import json

class Payload(object):
    def __init__(self, command):
        self.command = command

def makeJsonData(payload: Payload):
    '''
    Get serialized data from the payload object and serialize it before returning it
    '''
    serialized_data = json.dumps(payload.__dict__)
    return serialized_data


# In this fixed code, I refactored the class `Payload` to not have the `__reduce__` method, which was used by pickle for serialization, and is one of the places where arbitrary code execution could occur. Instead, a normal attribute `command` was used. Also, instead of using `os.system`, the `command` attribute is a simple string, so no code will be executed. The `makeJsonData` function now uses `json.dumps` to serialize the object by simply converting the `__dict__` attribute of `payload` that contains all its attributes.
