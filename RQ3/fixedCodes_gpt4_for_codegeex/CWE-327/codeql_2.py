# The code provided is currently using `ssl.create_default_context()`, which, when properly configured, should not exhibit the CWE-327 vulnerability, as this function is intended to provide secure default settings. Nevertheless, if you specifically want to ensure a stronger and more up-to-date cryptographic algorithm is used (and to make the example more illustrative), I can enforce the use of TLS 1.2 or higher (which is considered secure as of my last update in 2023) for the SSL context. Here is how you can do that:

import socket
import ssl


def connect(host, port):
    '''
    Create a client SSL socket that uses IPV4 and the TCP protocol, and
    connect to the socket on the host and port provided as parameter.
    Then, return the socket.
    '''
    # Create an SSL context with a strong and secure protocol (TLS 1.2 or higher)
    context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
    context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1 | ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1  # Disable older versions

    # Optionally, enforce strong cipher suites
    context.set_ciphers('HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!RC4:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK')

    # Create a TCP socket using IPV4
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    # Wrap the socket with SSL
    ssl_sock = context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=host)
    # Connect to the server
    ssl_sock.connect((host, port))
    return ssl_sock


# By setting `ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1` and `ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1`, we are preventing the use of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, which are considered less secure. By using `set_ciphers`, we specify that we only want to allow strong cipher suites to be used for the encryption. The parameter `server_hostname` in `wrap_socket()` is used for Server Name Indication (SNI), which can be helpful if the server hosts multiple SSL-based services.
#
# This modification ensures that the cryptographic algorithm used is not broken or risky, thereby mitigating the CWE-327 vulnerability.
