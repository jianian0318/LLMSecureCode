# The provided code may allow unauthorized users to access files related to other users or even system files by modifying the `username` or `date` parameters. This is done by directly using the inputted parameters to form a file path. To correct such Forced Browsing vulnerability, we need to validate inputs and ensure least privilege with adequate permissions.
#
# Here's the fixed code:

from django.http import HttpResponse
import os

def validate_input(username, date):
    # Check for relative paths or attempts to move up a directory.
    if ".." in username or ".." in date:
        return False

    # Add any other input validation that may be needed.

    return True

def getResource(request):
    '''
    Get username and date from the request, then
    send the file to the user by creating path by the username and date.
    '''
    username = request.GET.get('username')
    date = request.GET.get('date')

    if username and date:
        # Validate the provided username and date.
        if not validate_input(username, date):
            return HttpResponse("Invalid input", status=400)

        file_path = os.path.join(username, date)
        if os.path.exists(file_path):
            with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
                return HttpResponse(f.read(), content_type='application/octet-stream')
        else:
            return HttpResponse("File not found", status=404)
    else:
        return HttpResponse("Username or date not provided", status=400)


# In the above code, `validate_input` function checks whether the request is trying to traverse to directories which should not be accessible. In this case specifically, it checks for existence of ".." in username and date which indicates directory traversal. If there is a possibility of other malicious inputs, validate those as well inside `validate_input` function.
