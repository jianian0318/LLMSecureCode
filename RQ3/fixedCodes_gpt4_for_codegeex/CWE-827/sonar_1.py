# The original code doesn't have any measures to prevent an external Document Type Definition (DTD). To fix the vulnerability (CWE-827), we avoid loading the DTD by using the defusedxml library. Here is the corrected code which avoids loading the DTD by setting resolve_entities to False.

from lxml import etree
from defusedxml.lxml import parse

def getXmlRoot():
    '''
    Create an XML parser and parse the resources/c.xml file and return the root element
    '''
    # Create parser with resolve_entities set to False
    parser = etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)

    # Parse the XML file with the safe parser
    xml_tree = parse('resources/c.xml', parser)

    # Get the root element
    root = xml_tree.getroot()
    return root

# Please ensure defusedxml library installed in your python environment. You can do that by running pip install defusedxml if required.
