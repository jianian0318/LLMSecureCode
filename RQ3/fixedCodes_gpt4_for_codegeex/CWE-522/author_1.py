# To fix the CWE-522 vulnerability related to insufficiently protected credentials, we have to ensure that sensitive data, such as database credentials, are not hardcoded but instead securely stored and accessed, often using environment variables or a secure configuration management system. Here's an updated version of the code that uses environment variables for this purpose:


import MySQLdb
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from a .env file

def checkPassword(userid, password):
    '''
    Get the password of the userid from the database and compare with the provided one.
    Use environment variables to securely store database credentials.
    '''
    # Retrieve database credentials from environment variables
    db_host = os.getenv("DB_HOST")
    db_user = os.getenv("DB_USER")
    db_password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
    db_name = os.getenv("DB_NAME")

    # Connect to the database
    db = MySQLdb.connect(host=db_host, user=db_user, passwd=db_password, db=db_name)
    cursor = db.cursor()

    # Execute the query
    cursor.execute("SELECT password FROM users WHERE id=%s", (userid,))
    data = cursor.fetchone()

    # Close database connection
    cursor.close()
    db.close()

    # If the query result exists and the passwords match, return True, else return False
    if data and data[0] == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# To use the updated code securely:
#
# 1. Create a `.env` file in your project directory (make sure it is included in your `.gitignore` file if you use Git, so it is not checked into version control).
# 2. Add your database credentials to the `.env` file like this:
#
# ```
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_USER=myusername
# DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
# DB_NAME=mydb
# ```
#
# 3. Install the `python-dotenv` package if it isn't already installed, as it is used to load environment variables from the `.env` file:
#
# ```
# pip install python-dotenv
# ```
#
# By following these steps, you'll ensure your credentials are protected and not exposed in the codebase.
