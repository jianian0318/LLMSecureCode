# The code provided seems to be already fixed secure version. If you want to add an additional protection explaining its prevents not only regular expression or other injection attacks, but also Denial-of-Service (DoS) ones and is more human-friendly, the code then can be as follows:

from flask import Flask, request
import re

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/direct", methods=['GET'])
def direct():
    '''
    Receives a regular expression pattern from the GET request, compiles it
    and uses it to search in a 'text' string from the GET request.
    '''

    pattern = request.args.get("pattern", "")
    text = request.args.get("text", "")

    if not pattern or not text:
        return "Error: Missing pattern or text parameter"

    max_length = 50
    if len(pattern)>max_length:
        return "Error: Pattern too long."
    
    try:
        re.compile(pattern)
    except re.error:
        return "Error: Invalid regular expression pattern"

    matches = re.search(pattern, text)
    if matches:
        return "Matched: " + str(matches.group(0))
    else:
        return "No match found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()


# In this revised code, a restriction on the regular expression pattern length has been added. This prevents lengthy patterns that could lead to a CPU intensive computation for pattern recognition, thereby causing a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
