# The original code was vulnerable to RegEx Injection because it used unsanitized user input directly in re.search() function. This allowed a user to potentially execute any regular expression commands. In worst-case scenario, they could also cause Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by using expressions that take a long time to finish.
#
# We can fix this by validating or sanitizing the 'pattern' input to ensure it is of the correct format and doesn't contain any harmful expressions.
#
# Fixed Code:

from flask import request
import re

@app.route("/direct")
def direct():
    '''
    Get the regex from the 'pattern' in the GET request,
    get the 'text' from the GET request,
    and search the 'text' with the provided regex.
    '''
    pattern = request.args.get('pattern', '')
    text = request.args.get('text', '')

    # Ensure that pattern is a string containing only alphanumeric characters
    if not re.match("^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$", pattern):
        return "Invalid regular expression."

    try:
        match = re.search(pattern, text)
        if match:
            return f"Found match: {match.group(0)}"
        else:
            return "No match found"
    except re.error:
        return "Invalid regular expression."

# This fixed code first checks the 'pattern' input with a simple regular expression that only allows alphanumeric characters. If the 'pattern' input passes this check, then it proceeds with the rest of the function. If a re.error is thrown (meaning the pattern was invalid), a message is returned to the user. This limits the potential for RegEx Injection by only allowing very simple regular expressions and by catching invalid expressions before they can be executed.
