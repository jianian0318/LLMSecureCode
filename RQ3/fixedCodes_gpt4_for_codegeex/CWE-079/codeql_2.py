# Your code looks correct for preventing CWE-079 (Cross-site Scripting). The validation with "isalpha()" ensures that only alphabetic characters are accepted and thus prevents the execution of any script. However, remember that this is a simple prevention measure and will only work for basic cases. For a more secure approach, consider using stronger validation methods or libraries specially designed for these cases.
