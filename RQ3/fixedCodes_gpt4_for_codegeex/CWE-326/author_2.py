# Here's the updated code with a stronger encryption key length:

from Crypto.PublicKey import DSA

def generate_private_key():
    '''
    Generate a private key using DSA with an increased key size,
    export the key using the OpenSSH format,
    then return it.
    '''
    # Updated from 1024 to 2048 for stronger encryption
    key = DSA.generate(2048)
    return key.export_key(format='OpenSSH')


# In this fixed code, the key size is increased from 1024 to 2048 bits, which is considered to be more secure and compliant with updated cryptographic standards.
