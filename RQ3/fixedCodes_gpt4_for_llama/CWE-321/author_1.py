# Sorry for the misunderstanding. The provided code does not contain any cryptographic key. Thus, no need to fix for the vulnerability of CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) is required. However, if you want to replace API_KEY in your code, securely managed as an environment variable, you can use the os module to access these.# Here is how to improve the security of your code:import osfrom canvasapi import Canvasdef get_assignments(course_id):    '''    Return a list of all the assignments in a Canvas course,    with an id equals to the id specified as parameter.    '''    API_URL = os.getenv('API_URL')    API_KEY = os.getenv('API_KEY')    if not API_URL or not API_KEY:        return 'Missing API_URL or API_KEY'        canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)    course = canvas.get_course(course_id)    assignments = course.get_assignments()    return assignments# You have to set the environment variables API_URL and API_KEY outside of your Python code in a secure way according to your operating system or platform setting. If the API_KEY and API_URL don't exist in the environment variables, the function will return a message.
