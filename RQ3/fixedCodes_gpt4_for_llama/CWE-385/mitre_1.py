# To mitigate the timing attack vulnerability, the password comparison should be done in constant time regardless of where the mismatch occurs. You can use the `hmac` module to compare the hashes of the passwords in a way that is resistant to timing attacks. Here is the fixed code:

import hmac
import hashlib

def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
    '''
    Compare the actual password with the typed password using a constant-time comparison.
    '''
    return hmac.compare_digest(
        hashlib.sha256(actual_pw.encode()).digest(),
        hashlib.sha256(typed_pw.encode()).digest()
    )

# Example usage:
actual_password = "secure_password"
typed_password = "secure_password"
print(validate_password(actual_password, typed_password))  # This should return True

# Please make sure to keep the actual passwords secure and avoid logging or exposing them in any way. The `hmac.compare_digest` function provides a timing-attack-resistant comparison of the strings.
