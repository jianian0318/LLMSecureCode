# Here is the fixed code that addresses the uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability (CWE-400) by limiting the size of the input and controlling the complexity of the regex operation:

import re
from flask import request, Flask, abort

app = Flask(__name__)

# Maximum username length to accept
MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH = 100

# Maximum filename length to accept
MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH = 255

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload():
    '''
    Get the username and a file attachment from the HTTP POST request.
    Then, search the username in the filename of the attachment.
    '''
    username = request.form.get('username')
    file = request.files.get('file')
    
    # Validate the inputs
    if not username or not file:
        return abort(400, 'Missing username or file')
    
    # Guard against overly long input to prevent resource exhaustion
    if len(username) > MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH:
        return abort(400, 'Username too long')

    filename = file.filename
    
    # Guard against overly long filenames to prevent resource exhaustion
    if len(filename) > MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH:
        return abort(400, 'Filename too long')

    # Escape any regex special characters in username to avoid ReDoS attacks
    username_escaped = re.escape(username)

    if re.search(username_escaped, filename):
        return 'Username found in filename'
    else:
        return 'Username not found in filename'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()


# In this code, we've made the following security improvements:
#
# 1. We've switched the method from `GET` to `POST` because file uploads should be done via `POST`.
#
# 2. Added a check for whether username and file exist in the request.
#
# 3. Limited the length of the username and filename to prevent large inputs from causing resource exhaustion.
#
# 4. Escaped the username before using it in a regular expression search to prevent ReDoS attacks due to specially crafted usernames that can cause excessive backtracking.
