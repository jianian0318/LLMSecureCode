# In order to avoid CWE-611 vulnerability (also known as XML External Entity (XXE) attack), `etree.XMLParser` should be created with `resolve_entities` set to `False` which means it will not process any external entities. Here is how the fixed code looks like:

from lxml import etree

def get_root():
  # Avoid XXE vulnerability via `resolve_entities=False`
  parser = etree.XMLParser(remove_blank_text=True, resolve_entities=False)
  tree = etree.parse('resources/config.xsd', parser)
  return etree.XMLSchema(tree)


# This way, the parser will not process any XML External Entity from the XML file which is a common way attackers exploit XML processing.
