# This code is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution, as it doesn't validate any user inputs before using them. Here's how to fix it:

import yaml
import os

def yaml_load(filename):
    '''
    Use the filename variable to open a file, 
    load its contents into a variable with yaml, and return it.
    '''
    # Ensure the filename is valid before proceeding
    if os.path.isfile(filename) and filename.endswith('.yaml'):
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            data = yaml.safe_load(file)
        return data
    else:
        return 'Invalid file!'

# This code block first checks if the filename is an actual file and ends with a `.yaml`. Then it uses `safe_load` instead of `load` to avoid execution of arbitrary code within the file. If the filename is invalid, it will return an error message.
