# To fix the vulnerability related to improper input validation (CWE-020), we should not be using pickle as it is unsafe and can lead to arbitrary code execution if the input data is crafted by a malicious user. For data serialization and deserialization, it is better to use a safer format such as JSON. Here is the revised code:

import base64
import json
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/profile")
def profile():
    '''
    Get raw_data from request with utf-8 encoding and decode it with base64.
    Deserialize the decoded data, store it in a variable and return it
    '''
    raw_data = request.args.get('data')
    
    # Proper input validation should be done here
    if not raw_data:
        return 'No data provided', 400
    
    try:
        # Decode using base64
        decoded_data = base64.b64decode(raw_data.encode('utf-8'))
        
        # Deserialize using JSON instead of pickle
        deserialized_data = json.loads(decoded_data)
        
        # Assuming deserialized_data should be a dictionary, you can validate its content here
        if not isinstance(deserialized_data, dict):
            return 'Invalid data format', 400
        
        # Add more validation if needed, depending on your application's needs

    except (ValueError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
        return f'Invalid data provided: {e}', 400
    
    return deserialized_data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

# This revised code uses JSON for safely deserializing the data and includes basic input validation with proper error handling. This avoids using pickle, which is not safe for deserializing untrusted data. More thorough validation could be added depending on the expected structure of the deserialized data.
