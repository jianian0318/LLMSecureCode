# In the above code, the password is being hashed without a salt, which means identical passwords will result in identical hash strings. This can allow attackers to use rainbow table attacks to crack the hashed passwords. The fixed code will use a unique, random salt for each password, which will then be stored along with the hashed password.
#
# Here is the fixed code:

import hashlib
import os
import binascii

def storePassword(userName, Password):
    '''
    Hash the password with a salt and update the database with username, salt and hashed password by invoking the updateUserLogin() method
    '''
    # generate a unique, random salt for this password
    salt = hashlib.sha256(os.urandom(60)).hexdigest().encode('ascii')
    
    # hash the password with its unique salt
    pwdhash = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha512', Password.encode('utf-8'), salt, 100000)
    
    # store the salt and hashed password as a single string
    hashedPassword = binascii.hexlify(pwdhash).decode('ascii')
    
    saltedHashedPassword = (salt + hashedPassword).decode('ascii')
    
    updateUserLogin(userName, saltedHashedPassword)


# In this update, we first generate a random salt, which is then used to create a hashed version of the password. The salt and hashed password are then stored together as a single string, so that the correct salt can be used to verify passwords later on.
