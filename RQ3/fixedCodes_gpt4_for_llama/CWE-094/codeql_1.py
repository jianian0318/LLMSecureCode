# Here is a fixed version of the code without the code execution vulnerability. This fix avoids using `exec` or any type of code that would dynamically execute content from user input. Instead, it simply handles the `name` as a string variable. Also, it uses Flask's `methods` parameter to specify that the route should only accept POST requests, and properly decodes the base64 string to a string in UTF-8 format.

import base64
from flask import Flask, request, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/execute", methods=["POST"])
def code_execution():
    '''
    Get "first_name" from the post request object, and decode the string using base64.
    Then, call the setname function with the decoded first_name as argument.
    '''
    first_name = request.form.get("first_name")
    decoded_first_name = base64.b64decode(first_name).decode('utf-8')  # Decode to utf-8 string
    setname(decoded_first_name)
    return make_response("Success", 200)

def setname(name):
    # Do something with the name, ensuring that it doesn't execute code
    print(name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
