# The vulnerability in your code results from a predictable initialization vector (IV) you have hard-coded into the CBC mode of your cipher. Initialization vectors should always be random and unpredictable for secure encryption. Here's your fixed code:

import os
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

def getEncryptionKey(key):
    '''
    Create a Cipher using AES and CBC mode.
    Then, encrypt the key using this cipher and return it.
    '''
    # Generate a random initialization vector each time to ensure it's unpredictable
    iv = os.urandom(16)

    # Create a Cipher using AES and CBC mode with the random initialization vector
    cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CBC(iv), backend=default_backend())

    # Encrypt the key using the cipher
    encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
    encrypted_key = encryptor.update(key) + encryptor.finalize()

    return encrypted_key

# The os.urandom(16) function generates 16 bytes of secure random data, suitable for use as an IV in your cipher object.
