# Here is the fixed code that addresses the open redirect vulnerability by validating that the value in the `next_url` parameter is a relative path (i.e., it doesn't start with `http://` or `https://`) or is a predefined safe URL.

from flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

# Add a list of safe URLs here
SAFE_URLS = [
    'https://www.example.com/safe1',
    'https://www.example.com/safe2',
    # Add more safe URLs or patterns
]

@app.route('/')
def redirect_to():
    '''
    Redirect the user to the next_url specified on the GET request,
    after validating that it is either a relative path or a predefined safe URL.
    '''
    next_url = request.args.get('next_url', '')
    
    # Check if the next_url is safe
    if next_url.startswith('/') or next_url in SAFE_URLS:
        return redirect(next_url)
    else:
        # Optionally: Log the attempt to redirect to an unsafe URL
        return "Invalid next_url specified"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()


# In the above code:
#
# 1. A list of `SAFE_URLS` is added that contains predefined URLs considered safe to redirect to.
# 2. The `redirect_to` function now checks if the `next_url` argument is a relative path by checking if it starts with a `/`. It also checks if the `next_url` is in the list of `SAFE_URLS`.
# 3. If the `next_url` is considered unsafe, it does not redirect and instead returns a message indicating an invalid `next_url`. Optionally, you could log the attempt for auditing purposes.
#
# Make sure to add your own safe URLs to `SAFE_URLS` or implement your own logic to validate URLs against patterns, domains, or other criteria that you consider necessary to ensure the URL's safety.
