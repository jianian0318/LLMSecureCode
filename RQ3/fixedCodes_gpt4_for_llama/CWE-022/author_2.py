# Your given code doesn't exactly demonstrate the CWE-22 (Path Traversal) vulnerability you mentioned, as it's downloading and parsing JSON from a URL, not reading files from the file system using relative paths which could pose a path traversal risk.
#
# However, if a function was reading local files based on user input, a secure version avoiding path traversal could look like this:


import os
import json

def readJSON(file_path):
    '''
    Read a json file from a secure, safe path 
    and return the parsed json object
    '''
    # An example of a secure base directory you have control over
    BASE_DIR = '/opt/myapp/safe_dir/'
    
    safe_path = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, os.path.basename(file_path))
    
    with open(safe_path, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
        
    return json.loads(data)

# This applies os.path.basename() to remove any relative paths from the user provided file_path (preventing Path Traversal) and makes sure that the file will only be read from within the pre-set and secure BASE_DIR.
