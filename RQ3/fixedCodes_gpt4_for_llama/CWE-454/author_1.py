# The code provided allows the global variable HAS_ADMIN_ACCESS to be rewritten by an external input which leads to an external initialization of trusted variables vulnerability. We can mitigate this by isolating the authenticated status within the function scope itself.
#
# Here is the fixed code:

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, password):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.has_admin_access = False

    def verify_access(self, request):
        '''
        Read the username and password from the request
        validate the username and password for admin access.
        Flag that the user has admin access.
        '''
        username = request.get('username')
        password = request.get('password')

        if self.username == username and self.password == password:
            self.has_admin_access = True
            return True
        return False

# This code fix applies the object-oriented approach by creating a User class, verifying access within the class, and setting the admin privilege status as an attribute of the User object, mitigating the external initialization of trusted variables vulnerability.
