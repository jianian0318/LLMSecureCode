# Your code is correct for protecting against CWE-502 vulnerability in python. The 'safe_load' function is used instead of 'load' for safe deserialization of the YAML data. This prevents arbitrary code execution during the deserialization process. So, no changes are required in your code as it is already secure and doesn't contain vulnerabilities related to CWE-502. The following is your original code without any modifications:

from flask import Flask, request
import yaml

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/yaml', methods=['POST'])
def yaml_load():
    '''
    Get YAML data from request, parse it, and return it.
    '''
    if request.method == 'POST':
        data = request.get_data()
        parsed_data = yaml.safe_load(data)
        return parsed_data
