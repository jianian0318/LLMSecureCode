# The original code has a vulnerability as it blindly deserializes data without verifying the source. This is risky as it makes your program susceptible to malicious attacks. Here is a fixed version of your code.
#
# Creating the Payload class:

import os
import pickle
from typing import Any

class Payload:
    def __init__(self, data: Any):
        self.data = data

# The Payload class now simply stores data without the dangerous `__reduce__` method.
#
# Creating the `makePickleData` method:

def makePickleData(payload: Payload):
    return pickle.dumps(payload)


# This method remains the same, we just need to ensure we pass trusted data to `pickle.dumps`.
#
# Creating a `loadPickleData` method:


def loadPickleData(pickle_data: bytes):
    payload = pickle.loads(pickle_data)
    if isinstance(payload, Payload):
        return payload
    else:
        raise ValueError("Untrusted Payload Instance")

# Make payload data
payload = Payload('ls')
pickle_data = makePickleData(payload)

# Load trusted payload data
try:
    loaded_payload = loadPickleData(pickle_data)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# In this version of the code, the focus is on verifying the identity of the objects that are being unpickled. This way, we ensure that we donâ€™t accidentally execute potentially dangerous code.
