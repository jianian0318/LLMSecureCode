# The provided code is vulnerable because it uses the "pickle" module to deserialize token data, which can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. To fix it, avoid using the "pickle" module for this task. Instead, store tokens in a secure and simple data format like JSON. The JSON module is safe from arbitrary code execution.
#
# Here is a rewritten version of the provided code:

import base64
import json

def confirmAuth(headers):
    '''
    Get AuthToken from headers, decode it with base64, 
    and load with json to token object.
    check if the token is valid 
    and return the data in token object if it is valid.
    '''

    token = headers.get('AuthToken')
    
    if token:
        decoded_token = base64.b64decode(token).decode('utf-8')
        try:
            token_object = json.loads(decoded_token)
            if is_valid_token(token_object):
                return token_object.data
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            pass

    return None

# In this version, tokens are stored in a JSON format. This doesn't execute any code during deserialization, unlike the "pickle" module. The base64 decoded token is converted to string using "decode('utf-8')" before it is parsed into JSON, because "json.loads()" function expects a string. The "json.JSONDecodeError" is caught when deserialization fails.
