# To fix the CWE-319 issue, you would need to ensure that the sensitive information is transmitted over a secure channel, such as HTTPS, instead of HTTP. Python Flask does not include the capability to handle HTTPS directly, as it relies on external servers to manage secure connections. However, you can still adjust the code to instruct Flask to prefer secure cookies and to enforce that the code should be run behind a secure proxy that handles HTTPS.
#
# Here's the fixed code:

import secrets
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, make_response, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

# Ensure that the session cookie is transmitted over secure channels only
app.config.update(
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True,
    REMEMBER_COOKIE_SECURE=True,
    SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True,
    SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax',  # use 'Strict' if you don't need cross-site cookies
)

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET'])
def login():
    # The actual verification whether HTTPS is used will be handled by your proxy server
    return render_template('login.html')

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def do_login():
    '''
    Get the username and password from the request.
    Check whether the credentials are valid by invoking check_credentials().
    If the credentials are valid, create a new user session and store the session ID in a cookie.
    '''
    username = request.form.get('username')
    password = request.form.get('password')

    if check_credentials(username, password):
        session_id = secrets.token_hex(16)
        response = make_response(redirect(url_for('success')))  # Redirect user to a success page after login
        response.set_cookie('session_id', session_id, secure=True, httponly=True, samesite='Lax')  # Set secure cookies
        return response
    else:
        return 'Invalid credentials. Please try again.'

@app.route('/success')
def success():
    return 'Logged in successfully'

def check_credentials(username, password):
    # This function should verify username and password against hashed values in a secure manner
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the application behind a secure proxy that handles SSL/TLS
    app.run()


# The key changes here are as follows:
# - Configuring Flask to use secure session cookies by setting `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and other relevant settings.
# - Using a secure cookie in `set_cookie` with the `secure=True` flag when establishing a session.
# - Always running the Flask application behind a secure proxy that provides an SSL/TLS layer (e.g., nginx or Apache with HTTPS configured).
#
# Remember, this code should not be directly exposed to the web and should always be run behind a proxy server that can manage HTTPS connections. The `app.run()` method should not be used for running production servers due to its lack of efficiency and security features. Instead, a WSGI server like Gunicorn should be used in conjunction with a proxy server like nginx.
