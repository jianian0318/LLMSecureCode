# In the above code, the vulnerability lies where data is directly passed to a data query. To fix this, data validation or sanitization should be done. Here, the fixed code uses a password hash stored in the database instead of a plain password:
import boto3
import hashlib
import binascii

DYNAMO_CLIENT = boto3.client('dynamodb')

def hash_password(password):
    """Hash a password for storing."""
    pwdhash = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode('utf-8'), b'salt', 100000)
    return binascii.hexlify(pwdhash).decode('ascii')

def getUser(username, password):
    '''
    Get the user information from the users table by using its username and hashed password.
    '''
    hashed_password = hash_password(password)
    
    response = DYNAMO_CLIENT.get_item(
        TableName='users',
        Key={
            'username': {'S': username},
            'password': {'S': hashed_password}
        }
    )

    user = response.get('Item')

    return user

# In this fixed code, the password is hashed before it's used to query data, which neutralizes the potential risk of improper neutralization of special elements in a Data Query Logic. Be aware that salting, which adds additional data to the input of a hash function that changes its output, should ideally use a unique salt for each password which is not shown in this example for simplicity.
