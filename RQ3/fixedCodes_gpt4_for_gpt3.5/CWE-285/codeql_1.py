# This version of the code now includes a simple permission check, the admin_permission_check function. It's just a placeholder, but in a real system, it would have to check the actual admin permissions (for example, by making a database query).
#
# This function is now called in authenticate function. If the user doesn't have permissions, it raises an exception and execution stops. They are thus prevented from trying to authenticate themselves when they're not an admin.
#
# It's important to note that with this fix, the username argument in the call to authenticate must be a string.
