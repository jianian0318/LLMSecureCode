# To fix the vulnerability CWE-759, a salt should be added when hashing the password. The salt usually is a random string which is combined with the password, thus improving the security.
#
# Fixed code:
import hashlib
import os

def storePassword(userName, Password):
    '''
    Hash the password with a salt and update the database with username and hashed password by invoking the updateUserLogin() method
    '''
    # create a random salt
    salt = os.urandom(16)
    salted_password = Password + salt.hex()

    # hash the salted password
    hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(salted_password.encode()).hexdigest()

    # store salt and hashed password
    updateUserLogin(userName, salt.hex(), hashed_password)

# Please note that you also need to modify the `updateUserLogin` function to accept and store the salt with each user. When validating the password, use this salt with the input password, hash it, and then compare it with the stored hashed password.
