# Your code seems logical, but it does not tie the receiver and responder to the specific IP address. Also, the IP address isn't checked before sending the response. Therefore, someone may manipulate the IP address. Here is the fixed version of your code:

import socket

def sendData():
    '''
    This function creates a UDP socket and continuously receives 1024 bytes of UDP packet.
    After parsing each UDP packet (by invoking parseUDPpacket(data)),
    it sends the data to the appropriate requested IP address by invoking sendResponse.
    '''

    def parseUDPpacket(data):
        '''
        This function parses the UDP packet and returns the parsed data.
        '''
        # Your code to parse the UDP packet goes here
        pass

    def sendResponse(data, ipAddress, sock, destAddress):
        '''
        This function sends the parsed data to the requested IP address.
        '''
        # Check if the IP address from the received data is the same as the destination IP address
        if ipAddress == destAddress[0]:
            # Send the response
            sock.sendto(data, destAddress)
        else:
            print("Destination IP address does not match request IP address. Possible IP address manipulation.")

    while True:
        # Create a UDP socket
        udpSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

        # Bind the UDP socket to the specific IP and port
        destIP = "192.168.0.5" # Specific IP address
        destPort = 5005 # Specific port number
        udpSocket.bind((destIP, destPort))

        # Receive 1024 bytes of UDP packet
        data, address = udpSocket.recvfrom(1024)

        # Parse the UDP packet
        parsedData = parseUDPpacket(data)

        # Send the parsed data to the appropriate IP address
        sendResponse(parsedData, address[0], udpSocket, (destIP, destPort))

# Here, I added some features to your code:

# - I added the ability to tie the socket to a specific IP address and port.
# - Before sending out the response, it verifies the sender's IP address against the actual IP address.
# - If the IP addresses do not match indicating potential IP address manipulation, a warning message is printed, and the response is not sent.
