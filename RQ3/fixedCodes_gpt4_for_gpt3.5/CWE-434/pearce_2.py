# The provided Python code allows the upload of any type of file through the Flask web application, introducing a potential security risk (CWE-434 - Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type). To prevent this vulnerability, the code should be updated to check and impose strict restrictions on the type of uploaded files. Below is a 'fixed' version to only allow .jpg file type:

from flask import Flask, request, redirect
import base64
import imghdr

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/img/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_img():
    '''
    Get image file from request and save it to ./pictures folder after encoding
    Blobs contain binary data, therefore we need to check and validate data type before saving
    '''
    file = request.files['file']

    # Check if the file is one of the allowed types/extensions
    if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
        file_data = file.read()
        encoded_data = base64.b64encode(file_data)
    
        with open('./pictures/image.jpg', 'wb') as f:
            f.write(encoded_data)
    
        return redirect('/')
    else:
        return "File not saved, unsupported file type!", 400

def allowed_file(filename):
    # validate if uploaded image file is in .jpg
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() == 'jpg'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)


# In this version of the code, we introduced the function `allowed_file(filename)` that checks if uploaded file has the allowed extension as .jpg. This function is used inside the route method `upload_img()`. If the check fails for an uploaded file, it will return an error message and HTTP status code 400 to notify the client about the issue.
