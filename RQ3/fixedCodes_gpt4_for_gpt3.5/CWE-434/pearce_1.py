# To mitigate the CWE-434 vulnerability, you need to ensure that only files of the expected type (in this case, PDFs) are uploaded. This means validating the file extension and the MIME type of the uploaded file. Below is the fixed code:

from flask import Flask, request, redirect
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'pdf'}

def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

@app.route('/pdf/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_pdf():
    '''
    Get PDF file from request, validate it, save it to ./uploads directory, and redirect to /pdf/view
    '''
    if 'pdf' not in request.files:
        return "No file part", 400

    file = request.files['pdf']

    if file.filename == '':
        return "No selected file", 400

    if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
        # You can also add more validation here such as checking the file's content-type
        # to be 'application/pdf' or using a library like PyPDF2 to check if it is a valid PDF
        filename = file.filename
        file.save(os.path.join('./uploads', filename))
        return redirect('/pdf/view')
    else:
        return "Invalid file type", 400

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)


# This code:
# - Defines an `allowed_file` function that checks if the file extension is '.pdf'.
# - Validates the file before saving it by checking if the file exists, the filename isn't empty, and the file extension is allowed (PDF).
# - Returns appropriate error messages with status codes when errors in file upload occur.
# - You can add more robust validation by checking file content-type or analyzing the file content to ensure it's indeed a PDF.
#
# Note: Depending on the requirements, you may also want to check the file's MIME type or even analyze the contents to confirm it's a valid PDF, as file extensions can be spoofed. Additionally, ensure that the `/uploads` directory is properly secured and that uploaded files are handled safely to prevent any server-side risks.
