# To fix the potential SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) vulnerability in the given Python code, the user input should be validated and restricted to known-good values (i.e., the subdomain). Here's the fixed code:

import requests
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

ALLOWED_SUBDOMAINS = {'sub1', 'sub2', 'sub3'}   # example allowed subdomains

@app.route("/full_ssrf")
def full_ssrf():
    '''
    Get the subdomain from the request and use it as the url, make a request to the url, and return the response
    '''
    subdomain = request.args.get('subdomain')

    # Protect against SSRF by only allowing known subdomains
    if subdomain not in ALLOWED_SUBDOMAINS:
        return "Invalid subdomain.", 400

    url = f'https://{subdomain}.example.com'
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.text

# In the fixed code `ALLOWED_SUBDOMAINS` is a set of known-good (allowed) subdomains. When a subdomain is received from the request, it checks whether it is in the allowed set. If it's not, it returns an error instead of making a potentially dangerous request.
