# The above code is vulnerable to code injection because it directly uses the 'module_version' which is supplied from the request headers in the exec function. An attacker can supply any arbitrary code in the 'X-Module-Version' header that would be executed by Python, leading to a serious security vulnerability.
#
# Function exec() is like eval() and is one of the dangerous functions that you need to avoid while dealing with user inputs. To remove the vulnerability, the most recommended method would be to remove the exec function, yet maintain the required functionality.
#
# Fixed code:
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    '''
    Get the module version from the request object
    importing urllib module with the version by using conditional statements.
    '''
    module_version = request.headers.get('X-Module-Version', '')

    if module_version == '2':
        import urllib2 as urllib
    elif module_version == '3':
        import urllib3 as urllib
    else:
        import urllib

    return 'Hello, World!'


# In the fixed code, instead of using the exec function, the code checks the 'module_version' and accordingly imports the required urllib module. So, this would prevent any code injection vulnerability.
