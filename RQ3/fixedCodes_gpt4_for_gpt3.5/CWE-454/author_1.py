# This code initialization requires proper encapsulation and access control to prevent unauthorized external initialization. The variable HAS_ADMIN_ACCESS should not be global for secure practices. I've fixed the code with the use of class which encapsulates this variable providing getter and setter methods to control access to it. Below is the fixed version of code:

class Access:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__has_admin_access = False

    # getter method
    def get_access_status(self):
        return self.__has_admin_access

    # setter method
    def set_access_status(self, request):
        username = request.get('username')
        password = request.get('password')

        # Validate the username and password for admin access
        if username == 'admin' and password == 'admin123':
            self.__has_admin_access = True
        else:
            self.__has_admin_access = False

# In the context of the scenario, `Access` is now a class with the private variable `__has_admin_access`. To access or change the `__has_admin_access` variable, you must now use the `get_access_status` or `set_access_status` functions respectively.
#
# This helps ensure that these variables are not directly exposed or can be manipulated by external entities, hence making the code much more secure from CWE-454 vulnerabilities. The validation logic is enclosed within the scope of `set_access_status` function.
