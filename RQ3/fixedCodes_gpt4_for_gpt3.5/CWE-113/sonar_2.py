# HTTP response splitting occurs when data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request, and it is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web client without being properly validated. This could allow for harmful data to be injected into the server's response causing a variety of issues. The fixed code should not simply insert user-controlled input into headers and should validate or sanitize the input to ensure it does not contain any character sequences like `\r\n` that can alter the HTTP response.
#
# Here's the modified code:
from flask import Flask, request, Response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def route():
    '''
    Get the content_type parameter from the request,
    sanitize it to prevent HTTP response splitting,
    create a response with the content_type and send it as a response.
    '''
    content_type = request.args.get('content_type', 'text/html')
    # Ensure that the content_type does not contain any CR/LF characters to prevent response splitting
    content_type = content_type.replace('\r', '').replace('\n', '') 
    
    # You could add additional validation/sanitization here to improve security.
    # ...
    
    # Now create and send the sanitized response
    response = Response('OK', content_type=content_type)
    return response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()


# The `content_type.replace('\r', '').replace('\n', '')` lines ensure that any carriage return or line feed characters are removed from the `content_type` user input, preventing HTTP response splitting via input manipulation.
#
# Remember that for a robust solution you might want to implement a whitelist of allowed content types rather than removing specific characters, so only predefined content types are accepted within your application.
