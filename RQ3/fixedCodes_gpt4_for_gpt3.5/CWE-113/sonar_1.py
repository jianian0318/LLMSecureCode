# The provided code is indeed vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting due to the direct inclusion of the `content_type` parameter from the request into the response headers without adequate validation or encoding. Below is the fixed code that validates the `content_type` before adding it to the headers:

from flask import Response, request, Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

# Specify a set of allowed content types for security
ALLOWED_CONTENT_TYPES = {'text/plain', 'text/html', 'application/json'}

@app.route('/route')
def route():
    # Get the content_type parameter from the request
    content_type = request.args.get('content_type')

    # Validate the content_type to prevent HTTP Response Splitting
    if content_type not in ALLOWED_CONTENT_TYPES:
        # If the content_type is not allowed, set a default content type
        content_type = 'text/plain'

    # Create a response with the validated content_type
    response = Response()
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = content_type

    return response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()


# In this fixed code:
# - We define an `ALLOWED_CONTENT_TYPES` set containing safe content types that the server supports. This list should be populated according to the content types your application needs to support. This prevents the server from responding with arbitrary and potentially malicious content types.
# - We validate the `content_type` against the allowed list, and only use it if it is present in the list. If it is not a valid type or not in `ALLOWED_CONTENT_TYPES`, we default to a safe content type, like `'text/plain'`.
# - We safely set the `Content-Type` header using the `response.headers` dictionary, which automatically handles proper encoding to prevent HTTP header injection attacks.
#
# Make sure that the `ALLOWED_CONTENT_TYPES` contains all legitimate content types that your application may need to serve. It is a good practice to maintain strict control over what headers and content types your server emits to prevent various types of injection attacks.
