# The above code does not correspond to the vulnerability mentioned (CWE-321 - Use of Hard-coding Cryptographic Key). However, hypothetically, if the code used a hard-coded cryptographic key, the solution would be to make the key dynamic or store it in an environment variable for security. Here's how you could do this in Python:
import os
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def encrypt_message(message):
    key = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
    fernet = Fernet(key)
    encrypted_message = fernet.encrypt(message.encode())
    
    return encrypted_message

def decrypt_message(encrypted_message):
    key = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
    fernet = Fernet(key)
    decrypted_message = fernet.decrypt(encrypted_message).decode()

    return decrypted_message
# This code encrypts and decrypts a message using a secret key stored in the environment variable "SECRET_KEY". If "SECRET_KEY" does not exist in the environment, an error will be raised.
#
# For deploying applications, it's a common practice to store sensitive data like keys and passwords in the environment. It's safe because it's not hard-coded inside the application code, and can be changed easily without having to modify the code.
#
# Remember to set the environment variable "SECRET_KEY" before running this code.
