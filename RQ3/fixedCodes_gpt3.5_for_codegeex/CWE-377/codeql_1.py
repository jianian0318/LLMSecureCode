# Fixing the code to address the CWE-377 vulnerability:

import tempfile

def write_results(results):
    '''
    Create a temporary file and write the results to it
    '''
    file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
    file.write(results.encode())
    file.close()
    return file.name
# The fixed code utilizes the 'tempfile' module to create a temporary file using the 'NamedTemporaryFile' function. It ensures that the file is created securely and has a unique name. The file is opened in binary mode and the 'write' method is used to write the results to the file. Finally, the file is closed and its name is returned.
