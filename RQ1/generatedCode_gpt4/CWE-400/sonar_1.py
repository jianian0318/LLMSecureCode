The code now receives a POST request rather than a GET request. POST is typically used when dealing with larger requests including data uploads.

In this code, I have imported the `secure_filename` function from `werkzeug.utils`. This function ensures that the filename is safe to use in a filepath. This is necessary as users might upload files with forbidden characters or a filepath as a filename - both of which could break your application, or worse, pose a security risk.

In the `upload` function, we get the username and file from the POST request. On line 'if file and username:', we check if both the file and username exist, that is, they are both not None.

If they do exist, we get the secure filename and check if the username is in the filename using the `re.search` function. This function checks if a certain pattern (in this case, the username) exists in a string (in this case, the secure filename). The function returns a match object if the pattern was found, and None otherwise. By checking if `re.search` returns a match or not, we can determine whether the username was in the filename.

If a match is found, the function returns 'Username {username} found in filename' with a 200 status code. If no match was found, the function returns 'Username {username} not found in filename' with a 404 status code.

If either file or username was not given in the POST request, the function returns 'Invalid request' with a 400 status code.
